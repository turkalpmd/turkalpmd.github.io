title: Forecasting the Crowding of the PEDER
summary: In our hospital, the high volume of pediatric emergency room (PEDER) admissions was a serious problem. With our project, we aim to accurately forecast pediatric emergency room admissions in advance. By doing so, we can adjust doctors' schedules to allocate more staff during peak times. This will reduce patient waiting times while lowering the doctors' immediate workload, ultimately enhancing the quality of patient care.
Approximately four hundred seventy thousand records covering eight years were analyzed for this model. We're analyzing past visit trends, seasonal fluctuations, local events, and other relevant data that typically influence emergency room visit volumes.
This real-time model, which generates daily, weekly, and monthly forecasting reports about the admissions number of patients, helps optimize physician staffing by predicting overcrowding.
